    term: 'Nothing doing',
    definition: `"Nothing doing" is an idiomatic phrase that means "no way" or "not possible." It's used to refuse a request, deny a possibility, or indicate that something cannot or will not be done.
      When someone says "nothing doing," they are expressing a firm denial or refusal. It's a more emphatic way of saying no to a suggestion or request.
      The phrase is often used in informal conversations and can be seen as a slightly old-fashioned expression. It originated in the early 20th century and is derived from the idea that there is "nothing" that can be "done" about the situation or request at hand.`,
